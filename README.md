Consider a data-set of people residing in 10 cities, of genders Male/Female, and they are either Vegetarian or Non-Vegetarian. 
1. To get started with, you can select any random number as the population of a city, also you can further divide this population into Male/Female and Vegetarian/Non-Vegetarian.
2. Now create a nice form using CSS3/BootStrap3 with name of cities as rows and male, female, vegetarian, non-vegetarian as columns(so that will be like a  matrix of shape 10 x 4), each cell of this matrix will be a CSS3 input box that will take an integer as input. 
      2a. Initially, these values  should be filled with the random numbers you choose in step 1.
      2b. Also, these input cells should take input by the user.
3. There will be two charts on the page(one should be a pie chart, another one should be a bar chart), that you can make using D3.js or any other charting library.
4. The bar chart will have numbers of the people on Y-Axis and Name of Cities on the X-Axis. Furthermore, each bar should have two color codings, depicting the number of male/female in that city(vertically on the same bar).
5. Now as I change any number in the form from step 1-2, my bar and pie chart should dynamically change
6. If I click on any bar, than the pie chart of the corresponding city should show me the distribution of vegetarian and non-vegetarian people.
* 7. As a bonus task, Select a major color for this web page. And there should be an option to change this color using a color-palette.

The whole web-page should be responsive, so that it looks good on any screen size.
